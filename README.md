## FAQs
---
Q: I am new to coding (or just deciding to learn to code) and can’t build projects yet, what should I do?  
- The best way to start would be to follow FreeCodeCamp courses

Q: I’ve missed a day, does it mean I’ve failed the challenge?
- Absolutely not. You are allowed to miss one day (then make it up by adding one more day to the end of the 100), but never miss two days in a row. 

Q: I come home late, and by the time I am finished with my hour, it’s past midnight, does it count?
- Of course it counts! The rule of thumb is: have you coded for at least an hour before going to sleep that day? If yes, you are on track. The reason for this is that we all have different schedules and different life periods (kids, school, work, and what have you) so don’t hold yourself to some arbitrary time standard.

Q: Should I put my projects online?
- Definitely. It’s great for accountability and motivation to know that the stuff you’ve worked on is accessible online to anyone who may wish to look at it. It will make you care about the end product more, and will lead to a more impressive result in the end. Post on TPG's Github organization!
